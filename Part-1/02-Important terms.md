# List common terms in terraform
To get started with Terraform, it's important to understand some key terminology and concepts. Here are some fundamental terms and explanations.
1. **Provide**:Â A Provider is a plugin that lets Terraform interact with a specific service's API, like AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, or even GitHub. It acts as a translator, telling Terraform how to create resources on that particular platform

2. **Resource**:A Resource is a single piece of infrastructure you want to create and manage. This could be a virtual server, a database, a network, or a DNS record. It's the basic building block of your infrastructure.

3. **Module**: A Module is a reusable package of multiple related resources. Instead of writing the same code to create a web server and its associated network rules every time, you can package it into a module and reuse it easily.

4. **Configuration file (.tf)**: A Configuration File is where you write your Terraform code. These are plain text files, usually ending in .tf, that describe the providers, resources, variables, and outputs for your infrastructure.

5. **Variable**: A Variable is a way to make your configuration flexible without changing the code itself. You can define variables for things like region, server size, or names, and then provide different values for different environments (e.g., development vs. production).

6. **Output**: Outputs are values generated by Terraform after the infrastructure has been created or updated. Outputs are typically used to display information or provide values to other parts of your infrastructure stack.

7. **State file**: The State File is a critical JSON file that Terraform creates to keep track of the infrastructure it manages. It acts as a map between your configuration code and the real-world resources that exist. Terraform uses this file to know what it built, what needs to be changed, and what needs to be destroyed.

8. **Plan**: The terraform plan command is a preview of changes that terraform will make for your infrastructure When you run ``terraform plan``, Terraform analyzes your configuration and current state, then generates a plan detailing what actions it will take during the apply step.

9. **Apply**:
The ``terraform apply`` command used to executes the changes spesified in the plan. It performs the actions (create, update, destroy) to build or modify your infrastructure.

10. **Remote Backend**: A remote backend is a storage location for your Terraform state files that is not stored locally. Popular choices for remote backends include Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HashiCorp Terraform Cloud. Remote backends enhance collaboration and provide better security and reliability for your state files.

11. **Workspace**: Workspaces in Terraform are a way to manage multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with separate configurations and state files. Workspaces help keep infrastructure configurations isolated and organized.
