terraform configuration is where you define how terraform should connect and authenticate with the specific provider. It's like telling Terraform: "Okay, I want to manage resources in AWS, and here are my credentials to do so."

## Example
```bash
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0" # Always specify a version constraint!
    }

    # You can declare multiple providers here
    google = {
      source  = "hashicorp/google"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    # }
  }
}
```
